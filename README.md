# DC-Gan_Mnist

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow to recreate realistic handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset. It includes optimized training, data augmentation, and dynamic GIF visualization. To run the project on a Windows laptop:

1. Requirements: Install Python, TensorFlow, imageio, matplotlib, and IPython.

2. Clone Repository: Download or clone the repository from [GitHub Link].

3. Navigate: Open a command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Run Script: Enter the command python script_name.py, replacing script_name with the actual script filename.

5. Training: Observe real-time progress and checkpoint saving. GIFs of progress is shown below (you can add more epochs to get better final outputs)
